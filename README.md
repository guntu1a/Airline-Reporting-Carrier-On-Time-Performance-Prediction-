# Airline-Reporting-Carrier-On-Time-Performance-Prediction-

The Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance Dataset contains information on approximately 200 million domestic US flights reported to the United States Bureau of Transportation Statistics. This dataset includes basic information about each flight (such as date, time, departure airport, arrival airport, delayed flight time and the reason, and many more). We will be analyzing the data to understand the four vâ€™s (volume, variety, velocity, veracity) and represent the data in different forms of plotting. We will also build a machine learning model to predict the on-time reporting of an airline.
